Have you ever had some VPC & NAT gateway running over the weekend? Or multipe EC2 instance running for a couple of day? If the answer is yes, or you fear that this might be an issue for you, this module might be interesting for you.

I have experienced that myself even with budget alerts in place. The downside was, that I was already over budget before running the experiement. So no alert was triggered with an increasing bill.
